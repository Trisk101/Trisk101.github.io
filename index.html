          Will the glue of the poster cause damage to the wall?

        </button>
        <div class="pannel">
          <p>
            We use a strong glue to make sure the poster stays on the surface for a longer period of time. If taken off by force it will damage the wall a bit but won't cause significant damage.

        </button>
        <div class="pannel">
            <p>
                After the poster has lived it's life and comes off the surface, 
                it will leave some easily removable residue if not none.
